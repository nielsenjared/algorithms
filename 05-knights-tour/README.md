A Knight can move two spaces
in one direction and then move one square at right angles, or vice versa. It jumps to the new square
without visiting any in between, and must always land on a square on the board.



Find a sequence of moves that
starts from Square 1, visits every square exactly once by making such knight’s moves and finishes where it started.
