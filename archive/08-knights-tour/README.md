# Knights Tour

A Knight can move two spaces in one direction and then move one square at right angles, or vice versa. It jumps to the new square without visiting any in between, and must always land on a square on the board.

On a 5 x 5 board, find a sequence of moves that starts from Square 1 and visits every square exactly once by making such knight’s moves and finishes where it started.
