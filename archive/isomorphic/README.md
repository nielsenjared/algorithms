Write a function that checks whether or not two strings are isomorphic.
For two strings to be isomorphic, all occurrences of a character in string A can be replaced with another character to get string B. The order of the characters must be preserved. There must be one-to-one mapping for every char of string A to every char of string B.

isomorphic('paper', 'title') = true
isomorphic('egg', 'sad') = false
isomorphic('egg', 'add') = true
