# Anagram

Write a function that tests whether two strings are anagrams.

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as `cinema`, formed from `iceman`.

## Bonus

Compare strings of different case with punctuation and white space, but disregard the punctuation.

Example: 'fairy tales' is an anagram of "Rail safety!"
