Below is a map of the city of Königsberg, showing the river that runs through the middle, its two islands and the
seven bridges that cross the river. The tourist information centre would like to publish a route that visits each
part of the city (both banks and both islands) and that crosses each bridge once (and no more). It should start
and end in the same place. You have been asked to advise them. Either provide a route or if you can’t, explain
why it is not possible
