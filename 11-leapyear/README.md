# Leap Year

Determine whether or not a given year is a leap year.

## Hint
A leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:
* on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
* except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
* unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example: 2000 is a leap year but 1900 is not.
