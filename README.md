## Using Inpsect && Debug

Add a `debugger` statement at the point in your function you want to inspect.

Call the function.

Run `node inspect index.js`.

Press `c` to continue execution of the file until it reaches the `debugger` statement.

Enter REPL with `repl`.

`Ctrl + C` to exit REPL and again to exit debug.
